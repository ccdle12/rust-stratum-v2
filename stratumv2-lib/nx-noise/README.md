# NX-Noise

This code was generated using [Noise Explorer](https://noiseexplorer.com/) for
the `NX` pattern.

The only modifications made to the generated code is for non-cryptographic
purposes, such as applying the `Clone` trait for certain structs. Any changes
to this generated code should be reviewed very closely and should not edit
any cryptographic operations.
